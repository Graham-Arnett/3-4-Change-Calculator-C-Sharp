Tried this in java first because I want to learn both. This version made more sense. I forgot to make it work with handling decimal entries, so I might come back to this. I am thinking I'd like to add a few additional features in the future after I add the validation for integers only, maybe I'd add in more kinds of coins, or let you choose that currency's coins you'd like to use. It could also be cool to show an ascii coin on the screen when displaying results.
